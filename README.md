# AI-Photography

Here are some applications of Deep Learning that I use in my personal hobby of photography. 

## Getting Started

Using a python3 environment, run the following to install required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Recommend using conda or virtualenv to sandbox your work

### Manual Install 
Recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda does not come with TensorFlow or Keras so you will need to install those seperately. 
```
pip install tensorflow keras
```
For additional information on installing [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) and [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)

If you do not wish to use Anaconda, the following should satisfy the requirements: 
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```
